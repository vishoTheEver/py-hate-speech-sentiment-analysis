### Hate Speech Detection with Sentiment Analysis using Python üêç
___

Welcome to `PyHateSpeechSentiment`! This repository serves as a platform for CSCI 343's Coding Challenge #3, providing a hands-on experience in detecting hate speech via sentiment analysis techniques, all implemented in Python. Leverage your data science skills, apply text preprocessing methods, and dive deep into sentiment analysis practices using rich Python libraries and a dataset of social media tweets.

## üéØ Challenge Outline
Participants will be tasked with conducting sentiment analysis to ascertain the degree of "hatefulness" exhibited in a collection of tweets. Employ a designated lexicon and tweet dataset to navigate through the stages of lexicon preprocessing, tweet dataset preprocessing, and executing sentiment analysis through three distinct methods.

## üöÄ Getting Started
### Step 0: Preparation
- **Dataset**: Fetch and load a tweet dataset ([hatespeech.csv](https://olemiss.box.com/s/ftqas36kw1uauhqmajo59jy221fhk1ed)).
- **Lexicon**: Retrieve and load a lexicon ([expandedLexicon.tsv](https://olemiss.box.com/s/drzee8v82cv0mm6gbw7u2c615wrbdcyj)).

### Step 1: Lexicon Pre-processing
- Engage in meticulous data handling to filter and manipulate the lexicon data.

### Step 2: Tweet Dataset Pre-processing
- Load and tokenize tweet data, ensuring it's primed for sentiment analysis.

### Step 3: Sentiment Analysis
- Implement and visualize sentiment analysis via three unique approaches.

## üìÇ Repository Structure
- **Dataset**: Critical for pre-processing and analysis phases.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Perform your coding, analysis, and visualization in a Jupyter notebook, executed on Google Colab for optimum consistency.

## ‚úÖ Deliverables
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Ensure all code cells are executed and all outputs/plots are visible.
- **Documentation**: Provide a detailed explanation and documentation within the notebook.
- **Citations**: Ensure to cite all resources utilized in your notebook.

## üßê Evaluation Criteria
- Fulfillment of instructions and task completion.
- Code accuracy and implementation efficiency.
- Clarity and comprehensiveness of documentation and code comments.
- Quality of visualizations and interpretations derived from analyses.
